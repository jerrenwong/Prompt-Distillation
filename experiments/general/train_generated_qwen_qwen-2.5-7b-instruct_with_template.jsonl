If you make the magnets bigger or stronger, the motor can spin with more force.\n\n3. **How fast the motor is already spinning**: If the motor is spinning fast, it might need more power to spin even faster or against more resistance.\n\n4. **The resistance**: If there's something pushing against the motor, like gears or a load, it needs more torque to spin.\n\n5. **The design of the motor**: Some motors are made to produce more torque than others.
