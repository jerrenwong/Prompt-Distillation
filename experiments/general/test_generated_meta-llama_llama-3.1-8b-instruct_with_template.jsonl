Vitamin C works well with fat when it's being absorbed. This is because the body can easily combine fat and vitamin C, making it very easy for the body to use and process.\n\nIn the stomach, vitamin C is mixed with food, including fat. This mixture helps the body to absorb vitamin C more efficiently. That's why, when you eat foods high in fat, like oil or nuts, along with foods high in vitamin C, like fruits or vegetables, the vitamin C is absorbed very well.\n\nKeep in mind that vitamin C can also be absorbed from food alone, even without fat.

{"question": "when did university stop being free in australia", "response": "A good question! Free university education in Australia did not stop forever, but it stopped many years ago.\n\nIn the 1970s, Australia had a very good education system. Government made university education free for everyone. This meant that any Australian citizen, no matter their family's income or background, could study for free at a university. It was the right of every Australian to get a higher education.\n\nBut in the 1980s and 1990s, the government started to make university education not completely free. The government began to charge students a small fee for every course they took. This was a small amount of money, but it was still a fee.\n\nIn 2006, the Australian government made a big change. It introduced a system of loans for university students. This meant that students got a government loan to help pay for their education, but they would have to pay it back after they finished university and got a job.\n\nIn 2016, the government made another big change. It increased the cost of university education for many students. Now, students who study in certain subjects, like law, medicine, or engineering, have to pay even more money. Students who come from very low-income families also get extra help, which they don't have to pay back.\n\nSo, to answer your question, university is no longer completely free in Australia.
