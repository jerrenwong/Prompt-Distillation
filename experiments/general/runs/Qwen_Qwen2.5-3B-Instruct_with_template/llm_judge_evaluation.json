      "response": "Cadbury sells its products very widely, in many different countries around the world. It's like when you have a favorite candy and you find it in lots of stores where people live. Cadbury is in many places very far from each other, from Europe to Africa and even some places in Asia. So, very many people can buy Cadbury products there.",
      "judgment": "Correctness Reasoning: The response does not provide a specific number of countries where Cadbury sells its products, which is what the prompt asks for. Instead, it gives a vague description of the global reach of Cadbury without quantifying it.
