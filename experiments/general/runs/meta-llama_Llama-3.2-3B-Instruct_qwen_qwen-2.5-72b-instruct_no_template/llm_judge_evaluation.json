In 1954, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled in favor of the plaintiffs, declaring that segregation in public schools based on race was unconstitutional. This decision effectively overturned the \"separate but equal\" doctrine established by the court in Plessy v. Ferguson (1896).\n\nThe case was brought by the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) on behalf of Oliver Brown, a parent from Topeka, Kansas, who sought to have his daughter attend an all-white school. The case was consolidated with several other similar cases from other states, and the Supreme Court heard oral arguments in April 1954.\n\nOn May 17, 1954, the court issued its decision, which was a unanimous opinion written by Chief Justice Earl Warren. The decision declared that \"separate educational facilities are inherently unequal\" and therefore unconstitutional under the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. This ruling paved the way for the desegregation of schools and other public facilities across the United States.",

While it was not fully built during his lifetime, his designs laid the foundation for the development of the first electronic computers.\n\n2. **Alan Turing (1912-1954)**\n   - Turing made significant contributions to the development of the theoretical foundations of modern computer science. His work on the concept of the universal machine, which could perform any calculation given a set of instructions, is crucial to the modern CPU design. Turing's ideas were influential in the development of electronic computers, including the first electronic computer, the Automatic Computing Engine (ACE).\n\n3. **John von Neumann (1903-1957)**\n   - Von Neumann is credited with developing the stored-program computer, which is the basis for most modern computers. His design, as described in his 1945 paper \"First Draft of a Report on the EDVAC,\" laid the foundation for the modern CPU architecture, including the concept of a central processing unit and memory.\n\n4. **Other Key Contributors**\n   - **Konrad Zuse (1910-1995)**: Developed the first fully automatic digital computer, the Z3, which was the first electronic computer to use a binary system.\n   - **J. Presper Eckert and John Mauchly**: Developed the Electronic Numerical Integrator and Computer (ENIAC), one of the first general-purpose electronic computers.\n   - **John Bardeen, Walter Brattain, and William Shockley**: Developed the first transistor, which was a critical component in the development of the modern CPU.\n\nThese individuals, along with others, played crucial roles in the development of the modern CPU and computer technology.
