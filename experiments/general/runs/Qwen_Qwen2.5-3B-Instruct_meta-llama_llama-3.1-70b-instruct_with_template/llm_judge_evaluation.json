The parents said that black children should not be forced to go to separate schools, and that this was not fair.\n\nThe Supreme Court ruled that segregation in public schools is unconstitutional (not allowed by law). This means that it is illegal to have separate schools for different races.\n\nThe Brown v. Board of Education case was a very important victory for civil rights in the United States. It helped end the practice of racial segregation in public schools, which had been common in many parts of the country.\n\nThe person who wrote the opinion for the Supreme Court in this case was Chief Justice Earl Warren.

The Fe must be in a form that the body can use. This is called \"heme\" or \"non-heme\" Fe.\n2. The body needs to have enough healthy cells in the stomach and small intestine to absorb the Fe.\n3. The body needs to have enough vitamin C, which helps Fe be absorbed.\n\nIron from food is not always easily absorbed. To help with absorption, some foods are better than others. For example, meat, poultry, fish, and eggs all contain heme Fe, which is easier for the body to absorb. Foods like broccoli, spinach, and lentils also contain non-heme Fe, but it may not be as easily absorbed by the body.\n\nTo improve iron absorption, you can:\n\n1. Eat foods rich in vitamin C, like oranges, strawberries, and bell peppers.\n2. Cook foods that are high in iron in a way that preserves the Fe, like boiling or steaming.\n3. Take vitamin C supplements if you don't get enough in your diet.",
      "judgment": "Correctness Reasoning: The response accurately identifies the small intestine, specifically the duodenum, as the primary site for iron absorption in the body. It also provides relevant information about the forms of iron, factors affecting absorption, and dietary suggestions, which are all correct and informative. However, the mention of the \"last part of the Small Intestine\" is slightly misleading, as the duodenum is actually the first part of the small intestine. This minor inaccuracy affects the overall correctness score. \nCorrectness Score: 8\n\nInstruction Reasoning: The response is written in clear and simple English, making it accessible for non-native speakers.
