It helps find and remove bad viruses that can harm your computer. Regularly update your antivirus software to keep your computer safe.\n\n4. **Encryption**: Encryption is like wrapping your computer data in a secret box. It makes the data unreadable to anyone who doesn't have the key. This helps keep your data safe from bad people who might try to steal it.\n\n5. **Access Control**: Access control is like a gatekeeper who decides who can enter your computer system.

This way, the acid in your stomach can help break down the iron and make it easier for your body to absorb."

But some very important people helped create the first CPUs.\n\nOne of the first people to work on a CPU was Charles Babbage. He was an English mathematician and inventor. He designed a machine called the Analytical Engine in the 1800s. It was not a real CPU, but it was an early idea of a machine that could do many things like a computer.\n\nIn the 1940s and 1950s, some people at the University of Cambridge, like Alan Turing, worked on a machine called the Automatic Computing Engine (ACE). This was also not a real CPU, but it was another early idea of a computer.\n\nThe first real CPU was developed by a man named John Mauchly and his team at the University of Pennsylvania. They made a machine called the ENIAC (Electronic Numerical Integrator And Computer) in the 1940s. It was very big and heavy, but it was the first electronic computer.\n\nLater, other people like Ted Hoff and Stanley Mazor at Intel made smaller and faster CPUs. They developed the first microprocessor in 1971, which is the CPU that is used in most computers today.\n\nSo, many people worked together to develop the CPU over time."

This means they can vote again on the law, and if most of them agree, the law can become a law anyway.\n\nThis power is very important because it helps balance the power between the President and Congress."
