      "response": "The event you are referring to is known as the Watergate break-in. On June 17, 1972, a group of five men, including Virgilio Gonzalez, Bernard Barker, James W. McCord, Jr., Eugenio Martinez, and Frank Sturgis, broke into the Democratic National Committee (DNC) headquarters at the Watergate Complex in Washington, D.C. This act was part of a broader effort by the Nixon administration to sabotage the Democratic Party's campaign efforts.\n\nThe break-in and subsequent cover-up led to the resignation of President Richard Nixon on August 9, 1974, becoming one of the most significant political scandals in U.S. history.",
      "judgment": "Correctness Reasoning: The response accurately identifies the Watergate break-in and its significance, but it does not directly answer the prompt, which specifically asks for the name of the hotel. The prompt requires a brief answer, and the response includes unnecessary details about the event and its consequences. Therefore, while the information is correct, it does not fully meet the prompt's requirements.  \nCorrectness Score: 6  \n\nInstruction Reasoning: The response does not follow the instruction to keep the answer brief, as it includes excessive detail beyond just naming the hotel.
