However, in some countries, this limit may be 50cc for 16-year-olds and 125cc for 17-year-olds.\n\nA more general rule of thumb for a \"light motorcycle\" suitable for a 17-year-old is typically around 125cc to 250cc. However, this can vary depending on the country, state, or region's specific regulations.\n\nTo give you a better idea, here are some examples of motorcycle engine sizes and their corresponding licensing requirements in the US:\n\n- 50cc: License restricted to 16-year-olds\n- 125cc: License available to 16-year-olds, but often requires supervision\n- 250cc: License available to 17-year-olds\n\nPlease note that these are general guidelines and may not apply to your specific situation. I recommend checking with your local government or motorcycle regulatory agency for the most up-to-date information on licensing requirements and engine size limits for motorcycles."
