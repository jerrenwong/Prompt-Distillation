However, most countries have their own set of motorcycle licensing requirements and regulations.\n\nTypically, the engine size limit for a motorcycle to be licensed by a 16-year-old (or equivalent age) in the US is 50cc. However, in some countries, this limit may be 50cc for 16-year-olds and 125cc for 17-year-olds.\n\nA more general rule of thumb for a \"light motorcycle\" suitable for a 17-year-old is typically around 125cc to 250cc. However, this can vary depending on the country, state, or region's specific regulations.\n\nTo give you a better idea, here are some examples of motorcycle engine sizes and their corresponding licensing requirements in the US:\n\n- 50cc: License restricted to 16-year-olds\n- 125cc: License available to 16-year-olds, but often requires supervision\n- 250cc: License available to 17-year-olds\n\nPlease note that these are general guidelines and may not apply to your specific situation.

      "response": "I couldn't verify any information on a mountain named Mount Godwin Austen. However, I can tell you that the second highest mountain in the world is K2, which lies in the Karakoram mountain range.",
      "judgment": "Correctness Reasoning: The response correctly identifies K2 as the second highest mountain in the world and accurately states that it is located in the Karakoram mountain range.
