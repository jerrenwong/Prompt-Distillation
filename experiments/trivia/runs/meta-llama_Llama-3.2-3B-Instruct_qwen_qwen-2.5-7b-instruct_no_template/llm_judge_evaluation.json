It is used to measure the angle between two points on the Earth's surface, particularly in navigation where the latitude of a location is important.\n\nFor example, if you were to measure the angle between two points on the Earth's surface along a line of latitude, you would express that angle in degrees Clarke.

      "response": "On June 17, 1972, the group known as The Plumbers was caught breaking into Suite 610 of the Watergate Hotel in Washington D.C. This incident led to a series of events that ultimately resulted in the resignation of President Richard Nixon in August 1974.\n\nThe Plumbers, a group of anti-Nixon activists, had infiltrated the Democratic National Committee (DNC) headquarters at the Watergate complex and attempted to install wiretaps and bugs to gather intelligence on the Democratic Party. Their actions were discovered when they broke into the DNC headquarters, which was located on the same floor as the suite they were attempting to break into.\n\nThe Watergate scandal, as it came to be known, involved a wide-ranging investigation that implicated the Nixon administration in a cover-up of the break-in and its aftermath. It included evidence of obstruction of justice, abuse of power, and attempts to silence witnesses. The scandal led to the resignation of President Nixon in August 1974, making him the first U.S. president to do so.",
      "judgment": "Correctness Reasoning: The response correctly identifies the Watergate Hotel as the location of the break-in, which is the main focus of the prompt. However, it includes excessive detail about the events surrounding the break-in and the Watergate scandal, which is not necessary for answering the prompt directly. Therefore, while the core answer is correct, the additional information detracts from the succinctness required.  \nCorrectness Score: 7  \n\nInstruction Reasoning: The response does not adhere to the instruction to keep the answer brief, as it includes unnecessary details beyond just naming the hotel.
