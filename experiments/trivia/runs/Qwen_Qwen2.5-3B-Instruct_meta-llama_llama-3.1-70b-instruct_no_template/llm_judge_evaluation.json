      "response": "The term \"Supermarionation\" was actually coined by the BBC, and it refers to a special form of puppetry that they developed in the 1960s. However, the concept of animatronic puppetry had been around for some time before that.\n\nA key figure in the development of this technique was the puppeteer and showman Kenneth Griffith, who was known for his work on the children's television series \"The Wombles\" (1965-1982).\n\nGriffith developed a system of animating puppets using electronic controls, which allowed the puppeteers to control the movements of their puppets' mouths, eyes, and other facial features. This allowed the puppets to speak and sing in a more lifelike way than was possible with traditional puppetry.\n\nIt's worth noting that the term \"Supermarionation\" wasn't actually used to describe the technique until it was applied to the BBC's own production of \"The Wombles\" in 1965. The term became associated with this particular production, and has since become synonymous with the BBC's use of animatronic puppets in their children's programming.\n\nSo while Kenneth Griffith played a crucial role in developing the techniques used in Supermarionation, it was the BBC who popularized the term and gave it its name.",
