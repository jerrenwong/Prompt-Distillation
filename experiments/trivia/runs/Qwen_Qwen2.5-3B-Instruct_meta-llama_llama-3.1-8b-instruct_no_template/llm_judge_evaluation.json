While identical twins do share most of their genetic material, which means they are very similar, it's not guaranteed that they will have the exact same fingerprints.\n\nFingerprint patterns are determined by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. The specific pattern of ridges, valleys, and lines on a fingerprint is influenced by both genes and the unique environmental experiences a person has throughout their lifetime.\n\nWhile identical twins may have similar or even identical fingerprints due to their shared genetic makeup, there's always a small variation that can occur. These variations can be caused by differences in skin thickness, temperature, pressure, and other environmental factors.\n\nIn fact, studies have shown that identical twins have only about a 50% chance of having identical fingerprints. Even non-identical (fraternal) twins have a much higher likelihood of having different fingerprints.\n\nSo while identical twins are more likely to have similar fingerprints than non-identical twins, there's still a possibility of variation, which makes it a rare occurrence for them to have exactly the same fingerprints.",

It is named after Sir George Everest's geodetic surveyor, Alexander Ross Clarke, who introduced the system in 1857.\n\nIn the Clarke system:\n\n- Latitude is measured in degrees, minutes, and seconds (°, ' and \"), similar to the traditional sexagesimal system.\n- Longitude is also measured in degrees, minutes, and seconds (°, ', \").\n\nHowever, there are some differences between the Clarke system and the WGS 84 system:\n\n1. The Clarke system uses a different reference ellipsoid (Clarke 1866), which has a slightly different shape and size compared to the WGS 84 ellipsoid.\n2. The Clarke system uses a different prime meridian (Greenwich) than the WGS 84 system.\n\nSo, while both systems use degrees, minutes, and seconds for measuring latitude and longitude, they differ in their underlying coordinate system and reference points.\n\nIt's worth noting that modern GPS technology uses the WGS 84 system, not the Clarke system, as its default coordinate system. However, the Clarke system was widely used in the past and is still referenced in some older maps and geographic datasets.",
