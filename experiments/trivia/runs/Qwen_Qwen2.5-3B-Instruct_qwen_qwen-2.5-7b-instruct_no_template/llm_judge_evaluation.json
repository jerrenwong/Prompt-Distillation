Here's a breakdown:\n\n1. **Two wings**: This term indicates that all members of the Diptera order have only two pairs of wings.\n2. **Flies**: While many dipterans are indeed flies, there are other insects in this order as well.\n\nThe Diptera order includes various types of insects such as flies, midges, gnats, and others. These insects have evolved unique adaptations for their mode of life, such as having halteres (modified hindwings) instead of true hindwings or having a single pair of wings that they use to fly.\n\nSo, when you see the term \"Diptera,\" remember it refers to insects with two pairs of wings, though not all of them are flies.",

The Clarke spheroid uses a semi-major axis (equivalent to the equatorial radius) of approximately 6378200 meters and a flattening factor (f) of about 1/298.257223563, which gives it a slightly different shape compared to the WGS 84 model.\n\nIn the Clarke system, angles are measured in degrees, minutes, and seconds just like in the traditional sexagesimal system. However, when dealing with large-scale measurements or global coordinates, it's important to specify whether the angles are measured in degrees Clarke or another system to avoid confusion.\n\nFor example:\n- Degrees Clarke: This is the system used in many historical and older surveying documents.\n- Degrees WGS 84: This is the standard system used by modern GPS systems and other global navigation satellite systems.\n\nWhen working with data that includes angles measured in degrees Clarke, it's crucial to understand the underlying coordinate system to ensure accurate comparisons and calculations.",

This instrument developed in the 16th century and was designed to be placed on a small table or held in the lap for portability.
