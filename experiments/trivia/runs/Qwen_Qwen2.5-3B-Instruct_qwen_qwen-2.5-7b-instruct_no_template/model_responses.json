      "prompt": "What is the name given to the maximum amount of water a soil can hold?",
      "response": "The maximum amount of water a soil can hold is known as the wilting point. This is the point at which a plant begins to wilt due to the soil becoming too dry for its roots to absorb enough water. Beyond the wilting point, further moisture loss will cause the plant to die. The wilting point is an important indicator of the soil's capacity to support plant growth and is often used in agriculture and gardening to determine when watering is necessary."

      "prompt": "What is measured in degrees Clarke?",
      "response": "In the context of surveying and cartography, the angle measurement system used to measure angles on the Earth's surface is called the \"degrees Clarke.\" This system is based on the Clarke spheroid, which is a specific ellipsoid used for geodetic surveys.\n\nThe Clarke spheroid was proposed by George Everest and Alexander Ross Clarke as an alternative to the older WGS 84 (World Geodetic System 1984) model. The Clarke spheroid uses a semi-major axis (equivalent to the equatorial radius) of approximately 6378200 meters and a flattening factor (f) of about 1/298.257223563, which gives it a slightly different shape compared to the WGS 84 model.\n\nIn the Clarke system, angles are measured in degrees, minutes, and seconds just like in the traditional sexagesimal system. However, when dealing with large-scale measurements or global coordinates, it's important to specify whether the angles are measured in degrees Clarke or another system to avoid confusion.\n\nFor example:\n- Degrees Clarke: This is the system used in many historical and older surveying documents.\n- Degrees WGS 84: This is the standard system used by modern GPS systems and other global navigation satellite systems.\n\nWhen working with data that includes angles measured in degrees Clarke, it's crucial to understand the underlying coordinate system to ensure accurate comparisons and calculations."

      "prompt": "What original, standing outside the National Gallery and designated K2, was designed by Giles Gilbert Scott?",
      "response": "The building you are referring to is likely St. Pancras Station, which is indeed designated as K2 and designed by Giles Gilbert Scott. St. Pancras Station opened in 1868 and is considered a landmark of Victorian architecture. However, it's important to note that this is not the only significant structure designed by Giles Gilbert Scott that is located near or around the National Gallery.\n\nAnother notable work by Giles Gilbert Scott that is close to the National Gallery is St. Pancras Railway Station itself. However, if you're asking about an original, standing structure outside the National Gallery specifically designed by him, it might be more accurate to point out that he also designed the Victoria & Albert Museum (V&A) in South Kensington, although this is located farther from the National Gallery.\n\nIf your intention is to specify a location within a few miles of the National Gallery, then St. Pancras Railway Station would be the correct answer, as it is indeed near the area."
