This means that even identical twins, who share the same genetic makeup, will have slightly different fingerprint patterns.\n\nIn fact, studies have shown that the fingerprints of identical twins are only about 90-95% similar, with the remaining 5-10% being distinct differences. These differences are due to the unique environmental factors that each twin experienced during fetal development.\n\nSo, while identical twins may look very similar, their fingerprints are not identical, and they can be distinguished from one another using fingerprint analysis.", "model": "meta-llama/llama-3.1-70b-instruct", "template_applied": false, "prompt": "Identical twins have the same fingerprints?"}
