{"question": "Identical twins have the same fingerprints?", "response": "While identical twins do share virtually all of the same DNA and many physical characteristics, their fingerprints can still be different. Fingerprints are the result of the epidermis (the outer layer of skin) and underlying structures growing together during fetal development.

Even a tiny variation in how this growth occurs can result in distinct fingerprint patterns. Hence, while identical twins may share very similar or even almost identical fingerprints, they typically do not have exactly the same fingerprints.
