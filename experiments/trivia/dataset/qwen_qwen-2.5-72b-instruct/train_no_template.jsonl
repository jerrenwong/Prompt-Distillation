{"question": "What component of CFCs causes destruction of ozone?", "response": "The component of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) that causes the destruction of ozone is the chlorine atom. Here’s a detailed explanation of the process:\n\n1. **Release of CFCs**: When CFCs are released into the atmosphere, they can remain in the troposphere (the lower part of the atmosphere) for a long time due to their chemical stability.\n\n2. **Transport to the Stratosphere**: Over time, these CFCs can rise to the stratosphere, where the ozone layer is located.\n\n3. **Photodissociation**: In the stratosphere, CFCs are exposed to high-energy ultraviolet (UV) radiation from the sun. This radiation can break down the CFC molecules, releasing chlorine atoms (Cl).\n\n4. **Ozone Destruction**: The chlorine atoms then react with ozone (O₃) molecules. The reaction cycle is as follows:\n   - Cl + O₃ → ClO + O₂\n   - ClO + O → Cl + O₂\n   - Net reaction: O₃ + O → 2O₂\n\n   In this cycle, one chlorine atom can destroy many ozone molecules before it is eventually removed from the catalytic cycle.\n\n5. **Catalytic Cycle**: The chlorine atoms act as catalysts in the destruction of ozone. They are not consumed in the reactions but are free to continue the cycle, leading to the breakdown of more ozone molecules.\n\nThis process significantly reduces the concentration of ozone in the stratosphere, which is crucial for absorbing harmful UV radiation and protecting life on Earth. This is why the release of CFCs has been strictly regulated and phased out under international agreements like the Montreal Protocol.", "model": "qwen/qwen-2.5-72b-instruct", "template_applied": false, "prompt": "What component of CFCs causes destruction of ozone?"}

Here are some key aspects that AOC laws typically regulate:\n\n1. **Geographic Origin**: The laws specify the exact geographical area where the product must be produced. This area is often chosen for its unique terroir, which includes the soil, climate, and other environmental factors that contribute to the product's distinct characteristics.\n\n2. **Production Methods**: AOC regulations detail the specific methods and techniques that must be used in the production process. For wine, this can include the types of grapes allowed, the planting density, the maximum yield per hectare, and the vinification methods. For cheese, it might cover the type of milk used, the aging process, and the production techniques.\n\n3. **Quality Standards**: The laws establish quality criteria that the product must meet. This can involve sensory evaluations, chemical analyses, and other tests to ensure that the product meets the expected standards.\n\n4. **Labeling and Marketing**: AOC laws also govern how the product can be labeled and marketed. Only products that comply with the AOC regulations can use the AOC designation on their labels, which helps consumers identify authentic and high-quality products.\n\n5. **Inspection and Control**: Regulatory bodies are responsible for enforcing the AOC laws and conducting regular inspections to ensure that producers are adhering to the regulations.

{"question": "Which digestive organ is well-developed in grass-eating herbivores, but is only vestigial in humans?", "response": "The digestive organ that is well-developed in grass-eating herbivores but is only vestigial in humans is the **caecum**.\n\n### Explanation:\n\n1. **Caecum in Herbivores:**\n   - **Role:** In herbivores like cows, sheep, and horses, the caecum is a large, sac-like structure that plays a crucial role in the digestive process. It is particularly well-developed because it is essential for the fermentation of plant material, especially cellulose, which is a complex carbohydrate found in the cell walls of plants.\n   - **Function:** The caecum contains a community of microorganisms (bacteria and protozoa) that help break down cellulose and other fibrous materials into simpler compounds that can be absorbed by the animal. This process is essential for herbivores to extract enough nutrients from plant matter.\n\n2. **Caecum in Humans:**\n   - **Structure:** In humans, the caecum is a small, finger-like pouch located at the beginning of the large intestine, where the small intestine (ileum) joins the large intestine.\n   - **Vestigial Nature:** The human caecum is much smaller and less developed compared to that of herbivores. It is often referred to as a vestigial structure, which means it has lost most of its ancestral function. The human caecum, along with the appendix (a small, tube-like extension of the caecum), is a remnant of a more complex digestive system that was necessary for our ancestors who had a more plant-based diet.\n   - **Function:** In humans, the caecum does not play a significant role in the digestion of food, and its function is not well understood. It is often considered to have a minor role in the immune system, as the appendix contains lymphoid tissue.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe caecum is an important digestive organ in herbivores, adapted to their plant-based diet, but it is vestigial in humans, reflecting the evolutionary changes in our diet and digestive system.", "model": "qwen/qwen-2.5-72b-instruct", "template_applied": false, "prompt": "Which digestive organ is well-developed in grass-eating herbivores, but is only vestigial in humans?"}

{"question": "What prevents the earth's atmosphere from floating out into space?", "response": "The Earth's atmosphere is held in place by the planet's gravitational field. Gravity is a fundamental force of nature that attracts all objects with mass toward each other. The Earth's mass creates a gravitational pull that keeps the atmosphere from floating out into space.\n\nHere's a bit more detail:\n\n1. **Gravity**: The Earth's mass generates a gravitational field that exerts a force on everything, including the gases in the atmosphere. This force is what keeps the atmosphere bound to the Earth.\n\n2. **Atmospheric Pressure**: The weight of the air above any given point creates atmospheric pressure. This pressure helps to keep the air molecules close to the Earth's surface.\n\n3. **Escape Velocity**: For an object to escape the Earth's gravitational pull, it must reach a certain speed known as the escape velocity, which is about 11.2 kilometers per second (about 25,000 miles per hour). Most atmospheric particles do not have enough kinetic energy to reach this speed, so they remain bound to the Earth.\n\n4. **Thermal Velocity**: While some particles, especially lighter ones like hydrogen and helium, can sometimes reach speeds close to or exceeding the escape velocity due to their thermal energy, the vast majority of atmospheric particles do not have enough energy to escape.\n\n5. **Magnetic Field**: The Earth's magnetic field also plays a role in protecting the atmosphere by deflecting charged particles from the solar wind, which could otherwise strip away the atmosphere over time.\n\nThese factors combined ensure that the Earth's atmosphere remains relatively stable and does not float out into space.", "model": "qwen/qwen-2.5-72b-instruct", "template_applied": false, "prompt": "What prevents the earth's atmosphere from floating out into space?"}

{"question": "Who were Balthazar, Melchior and Caspar?", "response": "Balthazar, Melchior, and Caspar are traditionally known as the Three Wise Men, also called the Three Kings or the Magi.

According to the Bible, these men came from the East to pay homage to the newborn Jesus Christ, who they recognized as the King of the Jews.\n\nHere are some key points about them:\n\n1. **Names and Origins**: While the Bible does not provide their names or specific countries of origin, these names were later assigned by tradition. Balthazar is often associated with Arabia, Melchior with Persia (modern-day Iran), and Caspar (or Gaspar) with India. However, their exact origins and identities remain a matter of legend.\n\n2. **Gifts**: Each of the Magi brought a gift for the infant Jesus:\n   - **Balthazar** is traditionally said to have brought myrrh, which is a resin used in incense and perfumes, often associated with suffering and mortality.\n   - **Melchior** is said to have brought gold, a symbol of kingship and wealth.\n   - **Caspar** is said to have brought frankincense, a resin used in religious ceremonies, symbolizing divinity and prayer.\n\n3. **Journey and Prophecy**: The Magi followed a star that they interpreted as a sign of the birth of a great king. They first went to King Herod in Jerusalem to inquire about the newborn king. Herod, feeling threatened, asked them to find the child and report back to him. However, after they found Jesus and presented their gifts, they were warned in a dream not to return to Herod, and they took a different route back to their own countries.\n\n4. **Cultural Significance**: The story of the Magi has been a significant part of Christian art and literature. They symbolize the universal recognition of Jesus as the Messiah, not just by the Jews but by people from different parts of the world. In some cultures, the feast day commemorating the visit of the Magi, known as Epiphany or Three Kings Day, is celebrated on January 6th.\n\nThese wise men are often depicted in nativity scenes and are celebrated in various Christian traditions and cultures around the world.", "model": "qwen/qwen-2.5-72b-instruct", "template_applied": false, "prompt": "Who were Balthazar, Melchior and Caspar?"}

The name \"sterling\" is thought to have derived from the Old English word \"ster,\" meaning \"star,\" which was often depicted on silver pennies.\n\n2. **Early Development**: In the early days, the pound was divided into 20 shillings, and each shilling was further divided into 12 pence. This system, known as the £sd system (pounds, shillings, and pence), was in use until 1971 when the currency was decimalized.\n\n3. **Decimalization**: On February 15, 1971, the pound sterling was decimalized, and the system of 100 pence to the pound was introduced, simplifying transactions and accounting.\n\n4. **Continued Use**: Despite various economic and political changes, including the formation of the European Union and the introduction of the euro, the United Kingdom has maintained the pound sterling as its currency. The pound remains a major global currency and is widely used in international trade and finance.\n\n5. **Symbol and Notes**: The symbol for the pound is £, and the currency is issued by the Bank of England. The banknotes feature various historical figures and designs, and the currency is recognized for its stability and reputation.\n\nThe pound sterling's long history and continued use make it a unique and significant currency in the global financial landscape.", "model": "qwen/qwen-2.5-72b-instruct", "template_applied": false, "prompt": "What is the world’s oldest currency still in use?"}

{"question": "How many times can an A4 piece of paper be folded in half?", "response": "The number of times an A4 piece of paper can be folded in half is a common question that has been explored both theoretically and experimentally. The answer depends on several factors, including the thickness of the paper, the size of the paper, and the method of folding.\n\n### Theoretical Limitations:\n1. **Thickness Doubling**: Each time you fold a piece of paper in half, the thickness of the paper doubles. This exponential increase in thickness quickly becomes problematic.\n2. **Paper Size**: As the paper is folded, the size of the paper also decreases, which limits the number of folds that can be made.\n\n### Experimental Results:\n- **Britney Gallivan's Work**: In 2002, a high school student named Britney Gallivan determined the theoretical maximum number of times a piece of paper can be folded. She derived a formula to calculate the minimum length of paper required to fold it \\( n \\) times in a single direction:\n  \\[\n  L = \\pi t 2^{(n-1)}\n  \\]\n  where \\( L \\) is the length of the paper, \\( t \\) is the thickness of the paper, and \\( n \\) is the number of folds.\n\n- **Practical Experiments**: Britney Gallivan successfully folded a single piece of paper 12 times. This was done using a very long roll of toilet paper, which allowed her to overcome the limitations of the standard A4 paper size.\n\n### A4 Paper:\n- **Standard A4 Paper**: A4 paper is approximately 210 mm by 297 mm and has a thickness of about 0.1 mm.\n- **Folding Limit**: For standard A4 paper, the practical limit is typically around 7 to 8 folds. This is because the thickness of the paper becomes too large to handle, and the paper becomes too small to fold neatly.\n\n### Conclusion:\nWhile theoretically, the number of folds can be higher with special conditions and larger sheets of paper, for a standard A4 piece of paper, the practical limit is generally around 7 to 8 folds.", "model": "qwen/qwen-2.5-72b-instruct", "template_applied": false, "prompt": "How many times can an A4 piece of paper be folded in half?"}

{"question": "What are the natural pain-killing substances produced in the brain and pituitary gland?", "response": "The brain and pituitary gland produce several natural pain-killing substances, collectively known as endogenous opioids. These include:\n\n1. **Endorphins**: These are perhaps the most well-known natural painkillers. They are produced in the pituitary gland and various parts of the brain. Endorphins interact with the opiate receptors in the brain to reduce the perception of pain and can also produce feelings of euphoria.\n\n2. **Enkephalins**: These are smaller peptides that are found in the brain and other parts of the body. They bind to opiate receptors and play a role in pain modulation, as well as in the regulation of mood and emotions.\n\n3. **Dynorphins**: These are another type of opioid peptide that are involved in pain regulation. Dynorphins are produced in the brain and spinal cord and can have powerful pain-relieving effects. They are also involved in the regulation of emotional responses and stress.\n\n4. **Beta-endorphins**: A specific type of endorphin, beta-endorphins are produced in the pituitary gland and play a significant role in the body's response to stress and pain. They are particularly potent and can provide strong analgesic effects.\n\nThese endogenous opioids work by binding to specific receptors in the central nervous system, reducing the transmission of pain signals and altering the emotional response to painful stimuli. They are part of the body's innate pain management system and are released in response to various stimuli, including physical stress, emotional stress, and intense exercise.", "model": "qwen/qwen-2.5-72b-instruct", "template_applied": false, "prompt": "What are the natural pain-killing substances produced in the brain and pituitary gland?"}

While taking a bath, he noticed that the water level rose as he lowered himself into the tub. This observation led him to realize that the volume of water displaced must be equal to the volume of the part of his body he had submerged.

This is about \\(10^{14}\\) times the density of water.\n\n2. **Composition**: The interior of a neutron star is thought to consist mainly of neutrons, with a small number of protons and electrons. At such high densities, the atomic nuclei merge, and the protons and electrons combine to form neutrons through a process called neutronization.\n\n3. **Mass and Size**: Despite their small size (typically with a radius of about 10 kilometers), neutron stars can have masses that are 1.4 to 2.0 times that of the Sun. This combination of high mass and small size results in a very strong gravitational field.\n\n4. **Magnetic Fields**: Neutron stars often possess extremely strong magnetic fields, which can be trillions of times stronger than Earth's magnetic field. This can lead to phenomena such as pulsars, where the star emits regular pulses of radiation.\n\n5. **Rotation**: Neutron stars can rotate very rapidly, sometimes completing hundreds of rotations per second. This rapid rotation is a result of the conservation of angular momentum during the star's collapse.\n\nThese features make neutron stars unique and fascinating objects in astrophysics, providing valuable insights into the behavior of matter under extreme conditions.", "model": "qwen/qwen-2.5-72b-instruct", "template_applied": false, "prompt": "What is the defining feature of a neutron star?"}

{"question": "An apple seed contains which poisonous substance?", "response": "Apple seeds contain a compound called amygdalin, which can release cyanide when the seeds are chewed or crushed. Cyanide is a toxic substance that inhibits cellular respiration and can be lethal in sufficient quantities. However, the amount of cyanide released from a few apple seeds is generally not enough to cause serious harm to humans. It would take a large number of seeds to pose a significant risk. \n\nHere's a bit more detail:\n\n1. **Amygdalin**: This is a glycoside found in various parts of some plants, including apple seeds. When amygdalin comes into contact with certain enzymes in the digestive system, it can break down to release hydrogen cyanide (HCN).\n\n2. **Cyanide**: Hydrogen cyanide is highly toxic. It works by inhibiting the enzyme cytochrome c oxidase, which is crucial for the production of ATP (energy) in cells. This can lead to cellular hypoxia, where cells are deprived of oxygen, and can be fatal in high concentrations.\n\n3. **Risk**: While it's true that apple seeds contain cyanide, the amount in a typical apple is very small. Swallowing a few seeds whole is not a significant health risk because the seeds pass through the digestive system without releasing much cyanide. The risk increases if the seeds are chewed or crushed, but even then, it would take a large number of seeds to pose a serious threat.\n\n4. **Other Sources**: Other fruits and plants that contain amygdalin include cherry pits, peach pits, and apricot kernels. These should also be consumed with caution.\n\nIn summary, while apple seeds do contain a poisonous substance, the risk of cyanide poisoning from eating a few apple seeds is very low. However, it's best to avoid chewing or crushing them if you are concerned.", "model": "qwen/qwen-2.5-72b-instruct", "template_applied": false, "prompt": "An apple seed contains which poisonous substance?"}

{"question": "Where do the Graafian follicles develop?", "response": "Graafian follicles develop in the ovaries of female mammals. Here is a step-by-step overview of their development:\n\n1. **Primordial Follicles**: The development begins with primordial follicles, which are the earliest form of ovarian follicles. Each primordial follicle consists of a single oocyte (egg cell) surrounded by a layer of flattened follicular cells.\n\n2. **Primary Follicles**: Primordial follicles can be stimulated to grow into primary follicles. In primary follicles, the follicular cells begin to proliferate and form a single layer of cuboidal or columnar granulosa cells around the oocyte.\n\n3. **Secondary Follicles**: Primary follicles continue to grow and develop into secondary follicles. In secondary follicles, the granulosa cells form multiple layers around the oocyte, and a space called the antrum begins to form, which is filled with follicular fluid.\n\n4. **Tertiary (Antral) Follicles**: Secondary follicles develop further into tertiary or antral follicles. The antrum becomes more prominent, and the follicle grows larger. The granulosa cells continue to proliferate, and the theca cells (outer layer of the follicle) differentiate into the theca interna and theca externa.\n\n5. **Graafian Follicle**: The final stage of development is the Graafian follicle. This is the largest and most mature follicle. It has a fully developed antrum filled with follicular fluid (liquor folliculi) and a large, dominant follicle. The oocyte is positioned near the outer edge of the follicle, attached to the inner wall by the cumulus oophorus, a cluster of granulosa cells.\n\n6. **Ovulation**: When the Graafian follicle reaches maturity, it ruptures in a process called ovulation, releasing the mature oocyte (egg) into the fallopian tube. The ruptured follicle then transforms into the corpus luteum, which secretes hormones to support the early stages of pregnancy if fertilization occurs.\n\nThis entire process takes place within the ovaries and is regulated by hormones such as follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH) from the anterior pituitary gland.", "model": "qwen/qwen-2.5-72b-instruct", "template_applied": false, "prompt": "Where do the Graafian follicles develop?"}

{"question": "Which element makes iron rust?", "response": "Iron rusts due to the presence of oxygen and water. The process of rusting, also known as corrosion, involves a chemical reaction called oxidation, where iron (Fe) reacts with oxygen (O₂) from the air or water to form iron oxide (Fe₂O₃) or hydrated iron oxide (Fe₂O₃·nH₂O), commonly known as rust. Here’s a simplified version of the reaction:\n\n1. **Oxidation of Iron:**\n   \\[\n   4Fe + 3O_2 \\rightarrow 2Fe_2O_3\n   \\]\n\n2. **Hydration ( presence of water ):**\n   \\[\n   Fe_2O_3 + nH_2O \\rightarrow Fe_2O_3 \\cdot nH_2O\n   \\]\n\nIn the presence of water, the process can be accelerated because water acts as an electrolyte, facilitating the movement of ions and electrons, which enhances the corrosion process. Additionally, the presence of electrolytes such as salt (NaCl) can further accelerate the rusting process by increasing the conductivity of the water and making it easier for the chemical reactions to occur.", "model": "qwen/qwen-2.5-72b-instruct", "template_applied": false, "prompt": "Which element makes iron rust?"}

The bill is presented to the House, and the title of the bill is read out. No debate takes place at this stage, and the bill is then printed and made available to MPs.\n\n2. **Second Reading**: This is the stage where the general principles and purposes of the bill are debated. The House debates the main ideas and principles of the bill, and a vote is taken at the end of the debate. If the bill passes the Second Reading, it moves to the next stage.\n\n3. **Committee Stage**: This stage involves a detailed examination of the bill, clause by clause. The bill is usually considered by a committee of MPs, which can propose amendments. These amendments are debated and voted on. This stage can take place in a committee of the whole House, a standing committee, or a special committee.\n\n4. **Report Stage**: After the Committee Stage, the bill returns to the House of Commons for further debate. Any amendments made during the Committee Stage are considered, and additional amendments can be proposed and voted on.\n\n5. **Third Reading**: This is the final stage in the House of Commons. The bill is debated in its final form, and any last-minute changes can be discussed. The House votes on whether to approve the bill as it stands.\n\nAfter the bill has passed all these stages in the House of Commons, it then moves to the House of Lords, where it goes through a similar process. Once both Houses have approved the bill, it is sent for Royal Assent, which is the final stage before it becomes an Act of Parliament.\n\nIn summary, the bill has three distinct readings in the House of Commons: First Reading, Second Reading, and Third Reading.", "model": "qwen/qwen-2.5-72b-instruct", "template_applied": false, "prompt": "How many readings does an act of Parliament have in the House of Commons before being given royal assent?"}

{"question": "What is the maximum no of match points that can be held at one time in a tennis match at Wimbledon?", "response": "In a tennis match, a player can hold multiple match points at the same time, but there is no official maximum number of match points that can be held simultaneously.

If they win a subsequent point while still needing one more point to win the match, they would still be considered to have one match point. The term \"multiple match points\" is used to describe a situation where a player has multiple opportunities to win the match, but these are not concurrent; they are sequential.\n\nIn practice, a player could theoretically hold several match points in a row if they fail to convert the first few, but each one is still considered one match point. For example, if a player has match point at 6-4, 5-3, 40-15 and wins the next point, the match is over. If they fail to win that point and the score goes to deuce, they might get another match point at 6-4, 5-4, 40-30, and so on.\n\nSo, while there is no fixed maximum number of match points a player can hold at one time, in a practical sense, a player can only be one point away from winning the match at any given moment, making the number of match points they hold at any single point in time effectively one.", "model": "qwen/qwen-2.5-72b-instruct", "template_applied": false, "prompt": "What is the maximum no of match points that can be held at one time in a tennis match at Wimbledon?"}

{"question": "Which objects in space emit energy in pulses?", "response": "Several objects in space emit energy in pulses. Here are some of the most notable examples:\n\n1. **Pulsars**: These are rapidly rotating neutron stars with strong magnetic fields. As they spin, they emit beams of electromagnetic radiation, which can be detected as pulses when these beams sweep past the Earth. Pulsars can emit pulses in radio waves, X-rays, and sometimes even gamma rays.\n\n2. **Cepheid Variables**: These are a type of variable star that pulsates in a regular cycle, causing changes in brightness. They are used as standard candles to measure distances in the universe because the period of their pulsations is related to their intrinsic brightness.\n\n3. **RR Lyrae Variables**: Similar to Cepheid variables, these stars also undergo regular pulsations and are used to measure distances, particularly in globular clusters and nearby galaxies.\n\n4. **Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs)**: These are intense bursts of gamma rays that can last from a few milliseconds to several minutes. They are thought to be caused by the collapse of massive stars or the merger of neutron stars.\n\n5. **X-ray Binaries**: In these systems, a compact object (such as a neutron star or black hole) accretes material from a companion star, leading to periodic X-ray emissions as the material spirals in and heats up.\n\n6. **Blazars**: These are a type of active galactic nucleus (AGN) where a supermassive black hole at the center of a galaxy is accreting matter and emitting jets of particles. When these jets are directed towards Earth, they can produce pulsed emissions across the electromagnetic spectrum, including radio, optical, and gamma-ray wavelengths.\n\n7. **Magnetars**: These are neutron stars with extremely strong magnetic fields. They can emit periodic bursts of X-rays and gamma rays due to the powerful magnetic fields and the resulting crustal deformations.\n\nThese objects are studied to understand various astrophysical phenomena, including stellar evolution, the properties of neutron stars, and the behavior of matter under extreme conditions.", "model": "qwen/qwen-2.5-72b-instruct", "template_applied": false, "prompt": "Which objects in space emit energy in pulses?"}

Krill are abundant in polar and subpolar waters.\n\n2. **Small Fish**: Various species of small fish, such as herring, sardines, and anchovies, are often part of the diet of baleen whales. Humpback whales, for example, are known to feed on these fish.\n\n3. **Plankton**: Some baleen whales, particularly the right whales and bowhead whales, feed on plankton, which includes both plant plankton (phytoplankton) and animal plankton (zooplankton).\n\n4. **Copepods**: These are small crustaceans that are another important food source for some baleen whales, especially in certain regions of the ocean.\n\nBaleen whales use a method called \"filter feeding\" to capture their prey. They open their mouths and take in a large amount of water containing their food. They then close their mouths and push the water out through the baleen plates, which trap the food inside. This process allows them to efficiently consume large quantities of small prey.\n\nThe specific diet can vary among different species and can also change with the season and location.

He is shown to have doubts, fears, and moments of emotional distress, which are evident in songs like \"Gethsemane (I Only Want to Say)\" and \"Everything's Alright.\"\n\n2. **Charisma and Influence**: Jesus is portrayed as a powerful and charismatic leader who has a profound impact on those around him.

{"question": "According his famous poem, what had John Milton lost?", "response": "In John Milton's famous poem \"On His Blindness,\" he laments the loss of his eyesight. The poem reflects on his struggle with his blindness and his concern that he may not be able to serve God as effectively as he desires. The key lines that express his loss are:\n\n\"When I consider how my light is spent,\nEre half my days, in this dark world and wide,\"\n\nHere, \"light\" metaphorically refers to his vision, and \"spent\" means used up or lost. Milton wonders how he can continue to use his talents and serve God now that he is blind. However, the poem concludes with a resolution to persevere and find other ways to contribute, emphasizing that God does not require active service as much as patience and faith.", "model": "qwen/qwen-2.5-72b-instruct", "template_applied": false, "prompt": "According his famous poem, what had John Milton lost?"}
