Some rare varieties may have collectors' interest, which can drive up their prices.\n\n4. **Country of Origin**: The country where the Noble was minted can also affect its value.

The Clarke system is a method used to measure angles, particularly those involved in large-scale land surveys.\n\nThe most commonly used unit in the Clarke system is the \"degree,\" which is divided into 60 minutes (denoted as ' or \") and further divided into 60 seconds (denoted as \"). However, it's important to note that the Clarke system is not a standard unit of angular measurement; rather, it is a system of measurement used in specific contexts, such as geodetic surveys.\n\nIf you are referring to the \"Clarke arc second,\" this is a unit of angular measurement that is derived from the Clarke ellipsoid, a reference ellipsoid used in geodetic surveys. One degree of arc equals 3600 Clarke arc seconds.\n\nSo, to summarize:\n\n- **Degree (°)**: The most common unit in the Clarke system.\n- **Clarke arc second**: A unit derived from the Clarke ellipsoid, equivalent to 1/3600 of a degree.\n\nIf you need more specific information about the Clarke system or its applications, please let me know!",
