Therefore, it meets the requirement of being brief.\n\nConsidering these points, I would rate the response as follows:\n\n- It provides the correct answer.\n- It is brief and to the point.\n\nThus, I would score the response a [9].",

Nevertheless, it adheres to the instruction to keep the response brief. \n\nConsidering these factors, I would rate the response as follows: \n\n- It answers the question correctly.\n- It is relatively brief, but not as concise as it could be.\n\nOverall, I would score the response a [8].",
