      "response": "Overfitting happens when a model learns not just the underlying pattern in the training data but also the random noise. It’s like a student who memorizes all the answers to past exam questions instead of understanding the concepts—great performance on the practice tests, terrible performance on new questions.\n\n        In machine learning terms:\n            •\tDuring training, the model’s error keeps dropping.\n            •\tDuring validation or testing, the error starts increasing.\n\n        That’s the telltale sign: the model fits the training data too well and fails to generalize.\n\n        A few key causes and signs:\n            •\tToo complex model: Too many parameters relative to data (like a high-degree polynomial fitting 5 points perfectly).\n            •\tToo little data: The model has no choice but to “memorize” small quirks.\n            •\tToo few constraints: Lack of regularization (e.g., no dropout, no L2 penalty).\n\n        Typical ways to reduce overfitting:\n            •\tAdd more training data.\n            •\tSimplify the model.\n            •\tUse regularization (L1/L2, dropout, early stopping).\n            •\tUse cross-validation to detect overfitting early.\n\n        If you want, I can walk you through a visual or mathematical example (say, fitting polynomials of different degrees to the same dataset). It makes the intuition click sharply.",
      "judgment": "The MODEL_RESPONSE provides a detailed explanation of overfitting, including its definition, causes, signs, and ways to reduce it. However, the instruction specifically requests a short and concise answer. The response is quite lengthy and includes multiple points and examples, which goes against the instruction to keep it brief. \n\nGiven that the response is informative but fails to adhere to the instruction for brevity, I would rate it a [4].",

      "prompt": "What is overfitting?",
      "response": "Overfitting is a phenomenon where a model performs well on the training data but poorly on the test data.",
      "judgment": "The MODEL_RESPONSE is concise and directly addresses the definition of overfitting as requested in the INSTRUCTION. It provides a clear explanation without unnecessary elaboration, adhering to the requirement for brevity. Therefore, it effectively follows the instruction to keep the answer short and concise.\n\nI would rate this response a [10].",
